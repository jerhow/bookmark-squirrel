# Bookmark Squirrel
*Bookmark sharing for hoarders*

In my personal life, saving and sharing links a million different ways was getting out of control. This web app is an attempt to wrangle that chaos into one place, and have a better way to organize and share bookmarks.

Built on Ruby 2.6 + Rails 5.2 + PostgreSQL 11.3

UI is responsive so it should look pretty good on mobile, although it's only getting UAT'd on a couple of stock Android devices at the moment.

It's a work in progress, with more features to come. You can see it in action here: [bookmarksquirrel.com](https://bookmarksquirrel.com)
