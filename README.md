# Bookmark Squirrel
*Bookmark sharing for hoarders*

For me personally, saving and sharing links a million different ways is getting old. This is an experiment to see whether storing, organizing and sharing bookmarks from a centralized service provides significant benefit to me or not.

Built on Ruby 2.6 + Rails 5.2 + PostgreSQL 11.3

UI is responsive and should look pretty good on modern mobile devices.

It's a work in progress, with features still to come. You can see it in action here: [bookmarksquirrel.com](https://bookmarksquirrel.com)
